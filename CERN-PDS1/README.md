## Imlac PDS-1s at CERN

# Documents

MPS-CO-Computer-71-1: The original proposal for software for two PDS-1s at CERN. One was used to control part of the original CERN proton synchrotron (and had two displays on one CPU, but only one could be used at a time). The other one was used for a new machine called the Synchrotron Injector or (more commonly) the Booster. Later we bought a spare machine for backup. The machines were connected to an IBM 1800 that served as the main control computer.

MPS-CO-Note-71-21: The original proposal for how to use one of them.

MPS-CO-Computer-71-1: Initial technical proposal for software and connectivity.

MPS-CO-Computer-71-2: More details of the technical proposal.

MPS-CO-Computer-71-3: Programmer's guide.

MPS-CO-Computer-71-8: CERN MPS PDS1 Assembly Language PDSA.

MPS-CO-Computer-71-11: Proposal for the Injection Console Software.

MPS-CO-Computer-72-4: Programmer's guide (updated).

BC-PDS1-2311071_01: Brian Carpenter at the PDS-1 console, Oct. 1971.

PDS1-71-10-232: Plot of the vacuum measurements round the CPS ring, Oct. 1971. 100 measurements because the synchrotron is divided into 100 sectors.

PDS1-71-10-233: Plots of the proton beam's horizontal deflection from the ideal orbit around the CPS, and the currents in the horizontal dipole electromagnets used to correct the orbit. At the bottom, commands typed into the simple command interpreter to show displays and set magnet currents. The interpreter was inspired by Digital's FOCAL language but was *much* simpler. You can see the very simple and ugly font, which was designed to use an absolute minimum of memory space. Hence the rectangular letter O. We did slash the digit 0 to avoid ambiguity.

CERN-PS-MainControlRoom-7411001X: View of the CERN PS control room in 1974. If you look carefully, you can find two PDS-1 displays.

Potier-7402123X: Jean-Pierre Potier, an engineer-in-charge, at one of the PDS-1s in 1974.

Potier-Frammery-7402124X: Jean-Pierre again, with his right hand on a "shaft encoder". A command typed into the interpreter on the PDS-1 could link this encoder to control the current on a particular electro-magnet, with real-time feedback to the user on the orbital display above. His colleague Bertrand Frammery is in the background.
